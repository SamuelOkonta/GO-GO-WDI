## Technical Specifications
The concept of this project to create something similar to crunchyroll. The inspiration for the title of my project came a anime I used to frequent a couple years back called GO GO Anime.

This application has:

1.  Create two models
2. Complete RESTful routes for at least one resource (a project) with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
3. Uses Mongo queries and the Mongoose module to interact with a document database.
4. Promises to help build more complex queries!
5. Wireframes that were designed during the planning process.
6. Deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
